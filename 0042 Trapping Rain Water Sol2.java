// Using Dynamic Programming
// If there is a larger bar at one end (say right), we are assured that the water trapped would be
// dependant on height of bar in current direction (from left to right). As soon as we find the bar
// at other end (right) is smaller, we start iterating in opposite direction (from right to left).
// We must maintain left_max and right_max during the iteration

// Time Complexity O(n)
// Space Complexity O(1)
class Solution {
    public int trap(int[] height) {
        if(height.length == 0) return 0;

        int leftMax = 0, rightMax = 0;
        int left = 0, right = height.length-1;

        int ans = 0;

        while(left < right){
            if(height[left] < height[right]){
                if(height[left] > leftMax) leftMax = height[left];
                else ans = ans + (leftMax - height[left]);
                left++;
            } else {
                if(height[right] > rightMax) rightMax = height[right];
                else ans = ans + (rightMax - height[right]);
                right--;
            }
